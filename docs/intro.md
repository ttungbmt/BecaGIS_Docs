## Comparison with other tools {#comparison-with-other-tools}

Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features.

We've also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully to help you navigate through the prismatic choices out there.

### Gatsby {#gatsby}

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content.

GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides.

Many aspects of Docusaurus 2 were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative.

[Docz](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz) is a Gatsby theme to build documentation website. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus.

### Next.js {#nextjs}

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box.

[Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) is an opinionated static-site-generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus.

### VuePress {#vuepress}

[VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric website and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VuePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VuePress would be a decent choice.

### MkDocs {#mkdocs}

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a popular Python static-site-generator with value proposition similar to Docusaurus.

It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application, and don't plan to leverage React.

[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is a beautiful theme.

### Docsify {#docsify}

[Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly.

### GitBook {#gitbook}

[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) has very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs as an open source project's documentation site. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus [here](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3161).

Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone.

### Jekyll {#jekyll}

[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) is one of the most mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use ‚Äî in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook's Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll.

In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using `<script />` tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites performance, asset build pipeline and optimizations, and ease to setup.

## Something missing? {#something-missing}

If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) for us, or send a tweet mentioning the [@docusaurus](https://twitter.com/docusaurus) Twitter account.

For new feature requests, you can create a post on our [Canny board](/feedback), which is a handy tool for roadmapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!
